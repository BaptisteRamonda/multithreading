# multithreading
Includes all of Baptiste Ramonda's SRI 3A multithreading tutorials at UPSSITECH.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to set up an architecture to demonstrate multithreading in Python. To achieve this, we'll be using a queue manager to manage interactions between a boss, who will fill the task queue, and minions, who will process tasks and send them to the results queue.
